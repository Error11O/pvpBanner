# Towny pvp banner

if someone is too good at pvp or is harrassing builders / peaceful people or even just breaking combat rules,
instead of full banning them you can combat ban them (a fate worse then death for pvpers)
not allowing them to hit or be hit by people for however long the admin wants them banned.

this plugin was a made as a semi bit to the owner of Geofacts but :shrug:
